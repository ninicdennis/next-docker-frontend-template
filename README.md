# Next Docker Frontend Template

This is a template created with the default npx create-next-app node function. I ported this over to docker for a quick setup. Hot reloading is enabled.

## Getting Started

Build the docker container:
```
docker-compose build
```

Run the development server:
```
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Modifications can be created just the same as next, it is just now over towards docker.
